# Urban Nomad 🌍

> **Live Local, Explore Everywhere**

**Live app:** [urbannomad.onrender.com](https://urbannomad.onrender.com)

A React PWA that helps you discover what's happening in any city — whether you live there or you're just passing through.

## What It Does

Urban Nomad has two modes designed around two different mindsets.

### 📍 Local Mode
You're a resident of this city.
- Live event listings (concerts, sports, festivals, comedy, arts) sourced from Ticketmaster + Eventbrite
- Filter by category and date — "this weekend," "next 7 days," or a custom range
- Switch between a grid view and a calendar month view with today circled
- Save events to your phone for later
- Add events to your calendar (Apple Calendar, Outlook, Google)
- **Share local knowledge** — contribute insider tips that travelers heading to your city will see

### ✈️ Nomad Mode
You're visiting somewhere new.
- An AI-generated **Local Guide** for any city on Earth — vibe, etiquette, neighborhoods, food, transport
- The same live event listings, so you know what's happening during your trip
- **Read insider tips** posted by locals — the bus routes, the dive bars, the food trucks, the etiquette traps to avoid

## Built For Mobile

Urban Nomad is a Progressive Web App — you can install it directly to your phone's home screen from the browser. No app store required. Works fully offline for browsing previously cached content.

Native sharing, geolocation auto-detect, and the Add to Calendar export all work like a real native app once installed.

## Privacy & Ethics

Urban Nomad is built with privacy in mind:
- **No accounts, no logins, no tracking**
- Saved events and search history live only in your browser
- Community tips are AI-moderated to keep the space free of hate, harassment, and harmful content
